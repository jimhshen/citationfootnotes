# Introduction {#intro}

Lorem ipsum.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

This is a citation [@johndoe2020a].[^note1]

The citation in the footnote does not show up in the end of chapter references section, but does show up in the end of book references.


[^note1]: This footnote contains a citation [@janesmith2019]
