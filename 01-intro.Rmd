# Introduction {#intro}

Lorem ipsum.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

This is a citation [@johndoe2020a].[^note1]

Citations in footnotes in line doesn't work either

The citations in the footnotes do not show up in the end of chapter references section (right below this line), but does show up in the end of book references.

<div style=“display:none;”>
@bobjohnson2018
</div>

[^note1]: This footnote contains a citation [@janesmith2019]
