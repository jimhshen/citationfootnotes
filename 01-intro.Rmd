Lorem ipsum.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

This is a citation [@johndoe2020a].[^note1]

Citations in footnotes in line doesn't work either^[This is another footnote that contains a citation @bobjohnson2018]

The citations in the footnotes do not show up in the end of chapter references section (right below this line), but does show up in the end of book references.

[^note1]: This footnote contains a citation [@janesmith2019]
