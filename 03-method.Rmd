# Chapter-bib issues

Chapter-bib seems to ignore parts of the chicago-author-date CSL file and breaks bibliography entries by multiple authors where authors have a period in their name.

Cite John Doe's papers [@johndoe2019; @johndoe2020]. This does not suppress the author's name for the second article.

Cite a paper by multiple authors [@able2001; @able2002]. This does not suppress the author names for the second article.

Cite a paper by multiple authors with a period in the first author's name [@zebra2003; @zebra2004]. This results in two entries for Zebra 2003, and a suppressed set of names for Zebra 2004 (but without the expected --------).

If we look at the [References] section, the bibliography is rendered properly according to the chicago-author-date CSL file.
